                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>We would like to express our thanks to the Shelby White-Leon Levy  Fund for Archaeological Publication. The work of this publication fund  has done wonders for Mediterranean archaeology in general, and in our  case, it has been the driving force behind the publication of Tell  Dothan over the last three years. This publication would not have  happened anytime in the foreseeable future without the help of this fund  and its generous benefactors. Additional support was provided by  internal grants from the G. W. Aldeen Fund at Wheaton College, by the  United Nations Development Program, and by many hours of labor donated  by several generations of archaeology students at Wheaton College.</p>
                  <p>When  we came to Wheaton College, we were confronted by a daunting task.  Almost fifty years before our arrival, Wheaton had excavated an  important Palestinian tell, and yet there existed no final publication  to document the excavations. As we conceived of ways to move the Wheaton  Archaeology Museum forward, we knew that any plan would first have to  involve the publication of prior excavations in fulfillment of our  archaeological responsibilities. </p>
                  <p>Fortunately, the Tell  Dothan collection at Wheaton College had been cared for very well. For  decades AI Hoerth (who was Professor of Archaeology at Wheaton for 29  years) and more recently his former students Kenneth Hoglund and Deborah  Webber had been carefully curating this material. building a card tile  of the objects. and organizing the material in the hope, that a  publication might one day be possible. The first step, toward a  synthesis of this material were taken by Nathaniel Heller in his 2001 MA  thesis. Our work here stands on all of their shoulders and we thank  them for their input and long-suffering efforts. </p>
                  <p>While  we were aware of the work at Wheaton, we did not realize the extent of  the organizational work done by Robert Cooley until we visited  Jerusalem. Dr. Free had believed in distributing material widely in  order to spread the risk of the loss from any one storage facility.  Unfortunately, he left no map or record of these distributions, so it  was left to Robert Cooley to painstakingly track down artifacts for more  than three decades. His efforts insured the survival of a coherent  corpus from the excavations. This work was supported by the Dothan  Publication Committee, and particular thanks are due to John Rea, Walter  Kaiser, Carl Taeschner, Bonnie Hansen, and Joe Cunningham for their  financial contribution to these essential tasks. </p>
                  <p>In  the fall of 2001 we approached the Free Family Foundation. the holders  of the publication rights to this        material, and they graciously  agreed to let us proceed with a publication of the material on the tell  as part of a two volume publication program. Our volume on the remains  from the tell is Volume I and a forthcoming volume on the tombs of the  Western Cemetery is to be Volume II. We would like to thank Robert  Cooley and Abed Ismail for the trust that they placed in our work and  the help that they gave us every step of the way. </p>
                  <p>With  the permission of the Free family secured and the blessing of the Free  Family Foundation, we were then able to obtain permission from main  repositories of Dothan objects, including the W. H. Mare Archaeological  Institute at Covenant Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. St. George's  College in Jerusalem, and the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. Each of  these institutions kindly allowed us to inspect, photograph, and draw  the objects in their collections for the purpose of this publication. </p>
                  <p>Part of our publication involved the making of new  acquaintances in the Dothan valley as we visited the site and  ultimately conducted a brief survey in the summer of 2004. Through the  kindness of Bill Broughton we were introduced to the staff of the United  Nations Development Program Tim Rothermel. George Khoury and Nasser  Faqih offered us every available resource and facilitated a new  connection with the Dothan Valley and its hospitable residents, some of  whom had warm memories of Professor Joseph Flee. Our friends from the  United Nations introduced us to Hamdan Taha. Director General of the  Department of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage of the Palestinian  Authority, who graciously encouraged our work and was kind enough to  visit the site with us in the summer of 2003. </p>
                  <p>Once  we began the publication in our archaeology laboratory. We quickly  realized that we would need more help. We received the generous support  of the administration of Wheaton College, including the Dean of the  Humanities and Theological Studies, Jill Baumgartener, the Provost,  Stanton Jones, and two department chairs, Paul House and Richard  Schultz. In addition, our archaeology students stepped up to the  challenge, digitizing the records for almost forty thousand registered  pieces of pottery, scanning thousands of slides, editing texts, and  tracking down ceramic parallels. In particular, the students who  participated in our seminar on Tell Dothan in the fall of 2003 were able  to work on focused studies of Dothan's history. </p>
                  <p>Since  the pottery was in several countries, we relied upon several  illustrators for the plates. Our thanks go to Fadi Amira and Julia  Rudman in Jerusalem, Peggy Sanders in Chicago, and Jennilyn White,  Rebekah Williams. and Jon Walton in Wheaton. </p>
                  <p>The  publication process took us to Jerusalem in the summers of 2003 and  2004. While there, our work was facilitated by the Albright Institute  for Archaeological Research and its director Sy Gitin. In addition we  benefited from visits from Gabriel Barkay, Amihai Mazar, and Anna de  Vincenz, who all lent words of encouragement and advice to our pottery  sorting sessions. We are especially grateful to Ross Jones, the Dean of  St. George's College in Jerusalem, as well as the other staff of St.  George's School who offered their help and shared their facilities as we  analyzed their Dothan collection. </p>
                  <p>Over the  years, through archaeology conferences and public presentations, members  of the original Dothan excavation returned to tell us of the richness  and importance of the Dothan excavations. We hope that this volume opens  a window for the rest of the archaeological community to see what the  original excavators have long              known. This work stands as a  tribute to the long hours that they logged between 1953-1964 in an  effort to understand more about the history of Palestine and the ancient  stories of the Dothan Valley. </p>
                  <p>Finally, none  of this would have been possible without the vision of Joseph Free. He  was the founder of the archaeology program in which we have the good  fortune of working. Through his work, his students, and his family we  know him to have been an enthusiastic archaeologist and a passionate  teacher. His energetic work at Tell Dothan uncovered a rich and  important city that we hope can now make its long overdue contribution  to the understanding of ancient Palestine and the culture of the Dothan  Valley. </p>
