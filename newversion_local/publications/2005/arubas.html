                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>The 1992 excavations at the site (map ref. 1693/1326; fig. 1 on p. 6)  had been preceded by two excavations directed in 1949 and 1968 by M.  Avi-Yonah. The 1949 excavation is knovvn by the Arabic name, Sheikh  Badr. The 1968 excavation, conducted adjacent to the 1949 work, was  known by Giv'at Ram, the new name given to the whole area after 1949.  The ancient site is not yet firmly identified with any name found in the  ancient sources, but we may tentatively suggest that it might be <em>Iasonis pagus </em> (the village of Jason), rather than Deir Yasin (which is now the modern  neighbourhood of Giv'at Shaul, c. 1 km to the west of our site). </p>
                  <p>Air  photographs taken before the area was covered by modern roads and  buildings, coupled with the evidence of excavations and occasional  finds, indicate that the ancient site occupied c.4.5 ha. It covered the  slopes of the upper part of the elongated spur of Giv'at Ram, chiefly  around its summit (at 825 m asl). The archaeological discoveries  indicate that the site was inhabited from Iron Age II to the Byzantine  period (late 8th c. B.C. to early 7th c. A.D.); meager finds from the  Ummayad, Abassid and Mameluke periods do not seem to point to any  permanent occupation after the mid-7th c. The site's strategic location  at the top of the ascent from the coastal plain (or the start of the  descent for those leaving the old city of Jerusalem ) (fig. 1b on p. 6)  may be one reason for its inhabitation over such a long span. The Roman  road from Joppa (Jaffa) via Nicopolis (Emmaus) to Jerusalem, which was  one of the two main routes from the coastal plain to Jerusalem, passed  through a saddle between the N slopes of the site and the S slopes of  knoll 829 (northeast of the modern Central Bus Station) to the north  (fig. lc). From here the road descended gradually, following the course  of the present-day Jaffa road, into the city which lay some 1.5 Roman  miles to the east.  While relatively late in construction, this Roman  route probably reflects upon the importance of the site in earlier  periods.</p>
                  <p><strong>The excavation of 1949 </strong></p>
                  <p>The  first salvage excavation was conducted prior to the construction of the  national conven­tion center from July 4 to August 12, 1949 , by M.  Avi-Yonah. In the two main excavation areas extending over c.1750 sq. m.  (fig. lc on p. 6), he unearthed hewn installations, cisterns and pools  of various sizes dated by him to the Herodian period, numerous bricks  and tiles bearing stamps of the Tenth Legion, and the remains of a  monastery, of which the most distinguishable part were the foundations  of a three-aisled basilica (14 x 17.5 m). Adjoining its S wall was a  chapel dedicated to St George, according to an inscription in its mosaic  floor. This excavation was pub­lished only in an abbreviated fashion.   Because of insufficient stratigraphic documentation, the pottery report  published in Hebrew by M. Hershkovitz took the form or a typology; her  re­port is published here (chapt. 13) in English, as are the 3 coins  found then (G. Bijovsky, p. 223).</p>
                  <p><strong>The excavation of 1968 </strong></p>
                  <p>Prior  to the construction of a new hotel (then the Hilton, now the Crowne  Plaza ) to the south of Binyanei Ha'uma, in May to June 1968 Avi-Yonah  conducted a second salvage excavation adjacent to the E side of one of  the 1949 areas (fig. lc). In an excavation of c. 375 sq. m. he uncovered  remains of additional installations of the late 2nd c. B.C.- A.D. 70,  an oval-shaped potter's kiln (inside and around which were found  wasters), and ready-to-use clay a preparation area for clay, and a deep  water cistern. The area had then been covered by a thick layer of  plaster upon which were found some large mortaria and many bricks, some  bearing stamps of the Tenth Roman Legion. Some pits and other  installations were assigned to the Byzantine period. A short report  quickly followed.  R. Rosenthal-Heginbottom, who assisted Avi-Yonah,  then took it upon herself to publish the results of this work (chapter  12 below); the 20 coins from that excavation are again published by G.  Bijovsky (pp. 223-24).</p>
                  <p><strong>The excavations of 1992-93 </strong></p>
                  <p>In  the course of works for a new international convention center to, be  built adjacent to and east of the other one (Binyanei Ha'uma), severe  damage was caused to ancient remains. This prompted a large salvage  excavation (early April to late September, 1992) conducted by the  present authors on behalf of the IAA.  The excavation concerned the  parking lot (5000 m 2 ) lying east of the convention center (fig. 1c)  but by the time the excavations began roughly 60% of this area had  already been erased by bulldozers (fig. 1 on p. 10; fig. 3). Later, in  July 1993, a small excavation in the NW corner of our larger one (Area  D) was conducted by U. Ad.  Up to September of 1993, Ad also recorded  the process of dismantling the kilns of the Tenth Legion and the lifting  of a mosaic floor of the Byzantine period. </p>
