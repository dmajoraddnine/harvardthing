INTRODUCTION<br />
                </p>
                  <p>This volume is the second in a series of final reports,<br />
                    presenting the results of the excavations carried out at  Yoqne'am               between 1977 and 1987. The first volume (Yoqne'am  I), published               in 1996, was devoted to the later periods  excavated at the site               (Strata VII-I), from the Ottoman to  the Hellenistic period. The               present volume reports on the  Iron Age and Persian period strata               (XVIII-VIII).</p>
                  <p>The  Iron Age strata at Yoqne'am (XVIII-XI, most of which are divided                into several sub-phases) constitute the main theme of the  present               discussion, since they include the bulk of the  material. Furthermore,               the presentation of these srata and  the analysis of the material               uncovered in them make a  significant contribution to the archaeological               picture of  that period in the Land of Israel.</p>
                  <p>In this respect, the following aspects are noteworthy:</p>
                  <p>The almost uninterrupted sequence of Iron Age<br />
                    strata-eight in all-uncovered at Y oqne'am, spanning the  twelfth/eleventh               centuries BCE (the Iron Age I) through  the last third of the eighth               century BCE (the Iron Age  IIB/III);</p>
                  <p>The discovery and partial excavation of a  water system, one of               the very few in this country securely  dated to the Iron Age IIA               (the tenth century BCE);</p>
                  <p>The  uncovering of two superimposed defense systems, the earlier                a casemate wall and the later consisting of two parallel walls  separated               by a narrow passage (termed &quot;the gallery wall&quot;).  The latter               appears to be unique in this country so far  (with a possible exception               at Gibeon);<br />
                    <br />
                    The dense stratigraphic sequence resulted, among other  things, in               the recovery of a relatively large number of  ceramic assemblages               originating in loci of secure  stratigraphic attribution. This made               possible a detailed  study of the development of various ceramic               types  throughout the twelfth/eleventh-late eighth centuries BCE                (from the Iron Age I through the Iron Age IIB/III) and the rate                of their rise and decline in &quot;popularity&quot; (measured  statistically).               Of special importance in this respect is  the picture emerging with               regard to the development of the  ceramic typology throughout the               tenth and ninth  centuries. Most instructive is the comparative study               of  the Yoqne'am ceramic types with those uncovered in neighboring                sites (see map), such as Tell Qiri (a satellite site of Yoqne'am),                Megiddo, Tel Jezreel and Taanach, all in the Jezreel  Valley, Rosh               Zayit, located in the Lower Galilee, sites in  the northern coastal               area, such as Tell Keisan and Tel  Dor, and even with more distant               contemporary sites, such  as Hazor and Dan in the Upper Galilee.               The results of this  study are of great significance with regard               to the  controversy about the &quot;traditional&quot; versus &quot;low&quot;                chronology of the Iron Age II (Finkelstein 1996; Ben-Tor 2000).                In our opinion, it clearly supports the &quot;traditional&quot;                chronology of that period (Zarzecki-Peleg 1997a).</p>
