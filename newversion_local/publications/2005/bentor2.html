                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>Remains of the Bronze Age were uncovered at Yoqne'am in Areas A1 and  A4 (Photos L1-3). Area A1 is located on the northern slope of Tel  Yoqne'am (Plan 1.1, Squares L-N/19-21, O/19, P/19-20). This area is a  section excavated from the city wall of the Iron Age northward down the  mound's slope. The earliest remains uncovered here, built directly on  bedrock, are from the MB IIA. The entire stratigraphic sequence from the  early MB IIA (Stratum XXV) to the end of the Late Bronze Age and into  the Iron Age is represented in Area A1. </p>
                  <p>Area  A4 is a trench in the western slope of the mound (Plan 1.1, Squares  C-G/24-27), cutting through strata dating from the Iron Age II, the Late  Bronze Age and the MB II, and finally reaching fills of the EB III  found on bedrock. Except for a massive fortification system assigned to  Stratum XXIII, the remains of the Middle Bronze Age in Area A4 are very  poor. The remains of the Late Bronze Age, however, are better preserved  in Area A4 than in Area A 1. </p>
                  <p>In the present state of our  knowledge the extent of the Early Bronze Age settlement in Yoqne'am, if  indeed there was one, cannot be determined. Fills containing Early  Bronze Age pottery were found on the site's bedrock. The earliest  architectural remains uncovered so far are those dated to the MB II. </p>
                  <p>The  M B II remains in Yoqne'am were found mainly in Area A1 and include a  stratigraphic sequence comprising five strata, spanning the period from  the MB IIA to the MB IIC. Each of these strata represents a new phase in  the site's settlement history. The division of the Middle Bronze Age  into periods is based on the stratigraphic analysis and the study of the  pottery found on the floors of the different strata. The three earliest  strata, XXV, XXIVb and XXIVa, are assigned to the MB ITA, each  representing a different phase within this period. Based on the analysis  of the ceramic assemblages, Stratum XXIIIb appears to be a transitional  phase between the MB IIA and the MB IIB, whereas Stratum XXIIIa is  already characterized as part of the MB IIB. The following Stratum XXII  still belongs to the culture of the MB IIB. Stratum XXI represents the  MB IIC at Yoqne'am, though it also demonstrates some features of the  transition to the LB I (for detailed discussion, see Chapter 3). </p>
                  <p>Thus,  the temporal divisions based on the ceramic analysis do not always  conform with the stratigraphic ones. The transition between the MB IIA  and the MB 1113 occurs within Stratum XXIII: Stratum XXIIIb still shows  characteristics of the MB IIA, whereas Stratum XXIIIa already belongs to  the MB 1113. Stratigraphically, Stratum XXIIIb and Stratum XXIIIa vary  only in minor details. A similar case has been observed at nearby Tel  Qashish, where the transition between the MB IIA and the MB IIB occurs  within Stratum IX: Stratum IXc is a transitional MB IIA/B phase, whereas  Strata IXb-a are already dated to the MB IIB (Ben-Tor et al. 2003: 202,  212, 230). </p>
                  <p>During most of the Middle Bronze Age, from  Stratum XXIV of the MB IIA to the end of the MB 1113, Yoqne'am was a  fortified city. Three fortification systems were built in Area A1.  Yoqne'am was first fortified during Stratum XXIV by a massive city wall,  consisting of a mud-brick superstructure on a stone base (W.415, Plans  IL3-4) with a glacis attached to its outer face. A new fortification  system of a similar character was built in Stratum XXIII (W.402, Plans  11.5-6), and its western extension was uncovered in Area A4 (W.387, Plan  IL9). The third fortification system, built in Stratum XXII, includes a  stone-built city wall with a tower abutting its inner face (W.401, Plan  IL7). A new era in the history of the site, during which the city was  unfortified, started with Stratum XXI and lasted until Stratum XVI of  the Iron Age II. </p>
                  <p>The remains of Stratum XXI are supported  by a retaining wall built at the top of the slope (W.336b, Plan II.8). A  thick layer of fill sealed the remains associated with the final MB II  phase (Stratum XXI), on top of which was built a new settlement (Stratum  XXb), characterized by a new urban plan. </p>
                  <p>Though the  architectural remains associated with Stratum XXb are better preserved  in Area A4, we are unable to reach any comprehensive conclusions about  the character of the transition between Stratum XXI and the new  settlement erected immediately on top of it (Stratum XXb), due mainly to  the badly preserved remains of the former. This transition is most  evident in Area A1 (see the stratigraphic discussion of the Stratum XXb  remains in both areas, Chapter 4). The interruption in the stratigraphic  sequence between Strata XXI and XXb is not paralleled by the ceramic  assemblages, which display continuity between these two strata.  Moreover, in neither area did the excavation reveal any sign of a  violent destruction that might explain the stratigraphic break and  overall change in the nature of the architectural elements attributed to  each stratum. Together with the ceramic evidence mentioned above, this  phenomenon is of great significance for the character of the transition  between the Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age. </p>
                  <p>A  massive destruction terminated the LB I settlement at Yoqne'am (Stratum  XXa), which was followed by an occupational gap. Stratum XIX marks the  recovery of urban life at the site during the second half of the Late  Bronze Age. This recovery is characterized by the reoccupation of the  abandoned LB I site and the establishment of a new settlement on top of  it. This stratum, like the one preceding it, ended with a violent  destruction. </p>
                  <p>The ceramic assemblages uncovered on the  floors of Strata XX-XIX are an important tool for the relative  chronology and cultural attribution of these strata. These assemblages  demonstrate that the earlier phase of Stratum XX (XXb) dates from the  transitional MB IIC-LB I period, while the later phase of this same  stratum (XXa) already belongs to the LB 1 culture. Stratum XIX with its  two phases (XIXb and XIXa) should be dated, according to the ceramic  evidence, to the LB II. Both strata ended in a violent destruction. The  thick layer of debris separating these two strata represents an  occupational gap at Yoqne'am following the destruction of Stratum XXa. </p>
                  <p>The  destruction of Stratum XXa was an extreme event in the occupational  sequence of Yoqne'am; after it the site was deserted until it was  resettled during the LB II (Stratum XIXb). During the thirteenth century  BCE the site underwent another violent destruction, which brought to an  end the last Canaanite city at the site. The buildings of the early  Iron Age I settlement (Stratum XVIII) were erected on top of the ruins  of Stratum XIXa, signifying the beginning of a new cultural phase in the  occupational history of Yoqne`am. </p>
                  <p>The transition between  the MB II and the LB I is one of the most intriguing within the  sequence of cultures in Canaan , and one of the most problematic to  define and date. It has consequently been the focus of a number of  studies attempting to establish its cultural and chronological framework  (see, among many others, Weinstein 1981, 1991; Dever 1992 and  references there). Though the material uncovered by the numerous  excavations of stratified sites in Palestine during the past 60-70 years  has added valuable information, this issue is still a controversial  one, as attested by the disagreement even on its basic terminology. This  time span is characterized by the difficulty of correlating the changes  observed in the material culture with the historical events that took  place in Canaan at the close of the seventeenth and in the first half of  the sixteenth centuries BCE. The destruction and abandonment of late  Middle Bronze Age sites in the mid-sixteenth century BCE has  conventionally been assigned by scholars to the military campaigns of  the Egyptians kings of the early 18th Dynasty as part of their efforts  to drive the Hyksos out of Egypt and destroy their power in Canaan. In  recent years, however, this view has been challenged by scholars such as  Redford (1979), Shea (1979) and Hoffmeier (1989), who have au-gested  several alternative explanations for the destructions and abandonments  of the MB IIC-LB I. Furthermore, several different chronological schemes  have been suggested for the end of the Middle Bronze Age. </p>
                  <p>On  the other hand, the archaeological realia have to be confronted with  the historical picture, and here the ceramic assemblages are  significant. According to the archaeological evidence, the appearance of  new ceramic families which are considered hallmarks of the LB I, namely  the Chocolate-on­White and Bichrome Wares (as well as other ceramic  types and families; see Chapter 7), is used as a cultural criterion  marking the end of the MB IIC and heralding the beginning of the LB I  culture in Palestine. Since the early appearance of these ceramic  families in Palestine is closely related and considered to be synchronic  (around 1600 BCE), it is clear that the cultural change preceded the  historical change that took place several decades later. </p>
                  <p>It  is hoped that the evidence of the stratigraphy, combined with the  ceramic analysis and the typological comparison with other sites, will  form a solid foundation for the following discussion, in which we shall  attempt to reconstruct the occupational history of Yoqne'am during the  Middle and Late Bronze Ages. </p>
                  <p>Parts II and III deal with  the stratigraphic and ceramic analysis in chronological order, i.e. the  Middle Bronze Age Strata XXV-XXI are followed by the Late Bronze Age  Strata XXb-XIXa. Each part begins with the description of the  architectural remains by stratum, followed by analysis of the pottery of  each stratum. Photographs, plans and sections, and drawings and  photographs of the pottery, accompany each stratum. Since only a few  segments of floors could be assigned to the Middle Bronze Age sequence,  almost the entire ceramic assemblage associated with each of these is  presented, together with a few indicative sealed fills (glacis fills,  pits). On the other hand, since each of the Late Bronze Age strata  includes several floors, in most cases only the ceramic assemblages from  representative loci of each stratum accompany the discussion. </p>
                  <p>The  pottery figures are accompanied by tables that cite parallels to the  vessels, which are generally not noted in the ceramic discussion. The  reference for each parallel consists of abbreviated site name, volume  number or date of publication (in cases of more than one publication),  figure/plate number and stratigraphic provenance (stratum or tomb): for  example, Qashish, Fig. 89:2 (IXc). </p>
                  <p>Parallels for the  different vessels were primarily sought in Jezreel Valley sites (  Megiddo , Tel Qashish, Tel Qiri) in the vicinity of Yoqne'am. Megiddo  and Yoqne'am are the most important Bronze Age sites in the Jezreel  Valley , each located next to a major road junction (Wadi `Ara and Wadi  Milek respectively). The comparison of Yoqne'am with these neighboring  sites in terms of material culture emphasizes the relationship between  the sites in the different periods. </p>
                  <p>Second in importance  are more remote sites, located in the coastal plain (Tel Mevorakh, Tel  Burga, Tel Zeror, Tel Poleg, Kabri, Tel Nami), the eastern end of the  Jezreel Vallev (Tel Beth-Shean, Pella ), the hill country ( Shiloh ,  Shechem) and the Jordan Valley (Tell el-Hayyat, Jericho ), together with  other kev sites of the period (Tel Aphek, Hazor, Lachish ). In some  cases. parallels are cited from tombs containing rich assemblages  (Barkai, Kefar Szold, Ginosar, Tel `Amr). </p>
                  <p>In Part N the  ceramic repertoire of both the Middle and the Late Bronze Ages is  discussed. The typological analysis deals with the vessel's profile, its  relative quantity and its chronological range. This approach enables  evaluation of the continuity or discontinuity of the different ceramic  types throughout the periods, and may also help in determining the  transitional phases within this long continuum. The discussion is  accompanied by quantitative tables and at times by graphs illustrating  the main tendencies. </p>
                  <p>Part V presents the stratigraphic,  ceramic and glypti, remains of the Early Bronze Age, a scarab  impression, stone objects, flint tools, loomweights, metal objects,  worked bone, and human and faunal remains. </p>
