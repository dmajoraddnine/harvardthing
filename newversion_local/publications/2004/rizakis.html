                <td width="172" align="center" valign="top" nowrap="nowrap"><p><img src="rizakis_covertb.jpg" width="144" height="196" /></p></td>
                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>The catalogue includes both Roman citizens and peregrini who employed                Roman names, which they did either because of kinship  ties through               marriage or simply because it was the current  fashion to use Roman               names. The catalogue, therefore,  does not contain the purely Greek               names of peregrini that  remained untouched by Roman onomastic practices.               Such  persons are, however, discussed in the comments on particular                names, when it has seemed helpful to elucidate extended  relationships,               either of blood or by marriage. Likewise,  individuals who are referred               to in literary sources or in  inscriptions from other regions are               excluded from the  catalogue, although reference to them may sometimes               be  made in the comments. Thus the present work is not to be viewed                so much as a lexicon or even a complete prosopography, but rather                as one whose main aim is to present a particular social  class active               at a particular time and place, namely the  southern Peloponnese               from the beginning of the Roman  domination until Late Antiquity               (Roman Peloponnese I, 40  n. 23).<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Laconia:</strong> The  inscriptions employed for the Onomasticon of Laconia                come, with a very few exceptions, from today's prefecture of the                same name, since the area covered by the prefecture is very much                the same as that comprehended by the Laconia of antiquity,  with               the exception of the ager Denthaliatis, which was  for centuries               a source of friction between Messene and  Sparta (MES 227). This               region has been included in  Messenia because today it belongs to               the modem prefecture  of Messenia. Thuria also, is included in Messenia,                although an inscription dating to the imperial period shows that                Sparta was then her metropolis (MES 265). The same holds true for                the region of Kynouria, which, likewise, was a source of  friction               between Sparta and Argos. During the Imperial  period Kynouria belonged               to the Argolid, with which it has  accordingly been placed (ARG 63).               Only the city of  Prasiai belonged, during this period, to the Eleutherolakones                (Paus. III. 21, 7; 24, 4; cf. ARG 64). By contrast, the island of                Kythera, given by Augustus to Eurycles (Strabo VIII. 5, 3),  which               today is part of the prefecture of the Peiraeus, has  been grouped               with Laconia, to which it belonged in  antiquity. The same is the               case for the cities of the  Eleutherolakones. These include, among               other cities and  areas, the important harbour of Gytheion, the habour               of  Boiai, Tainaron, which was refounded as Caenopolis, Thalamai,                Oitylos and, of course, Asopos, located between Gytheion and Boiai                '.</p>
                <p>The majority of the inscriptions from Sparta  dating to the Imperial               period were found in the various  systematic excavations carried               out from the beginning of  the twentieth century by the British School               at Athens in  the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia and in the area of               the  ancient theatre. </p></td>
