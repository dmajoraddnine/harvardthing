                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>For a site that has been well known for its tombs, this volume on  Early Bronze Age settlement at Bâb edh-Dhrâ&lsquo; brings a new perspective by  turning attention from the cemetery to the living community and its  activities, insofar as these can be reconstructed from the  archaeological finds. The burial evidence and accompanying artifacts are  naturally always important in themselves as well as for comparison, and  reference to them will be found at many places in this volume. But the  focus here is on a large body of data relating to the people who settled  this Early Bronze site from the latter quarter of the fourth to the end  of the third millennium B.C.</p>
                  <p>Lapp's excavations in 1965 were the  first to show that Bâb edh-Dhrâ&lsquo; was an Early Bronze Age settlement  rather than a specialized ceremonial site, as many had speculated prior  to his work (P. Lapp 1966: 560-61; for references to the prevalent  interpretation of the site as a distinctive one accompanied by cultic  activities see Schaub and Rast 1989: 17-18). Following upon Lapp's  discoveries, the several seasons of the Expedition to the Dead Sea Plain  (EDSP) have uncovered a great deal more evidence for the history of  Early Bronze settlement here. Therefore, it now has to be recognized  that if a special significance is to be ascribed to Bâb edh-Dhrâ&lsquo; it is  not because it was an unusual site in antiquity but rather because it  provides a unique case of Early Bronze Age urbanism in an exceptional  part of the country, the isolated environment along the southeastern  Dead Sea Plain. Bâb edh-Dhrâ&lsquo; takes its place within the discussion of  the social and political events occurring on both sides of the Jordan  Rift during the late fourth and third millennia B.C. Its remains open a  window to the lifeways of the people who constructed its numerous tombs  throughout the entire Early Bronze Age.</p>
                <p>This volume is the second  in the series Reports of the Expedition to the Dead Sea Plain, Jordan.  The first contained the final publication of all tombs excavated in the  cemetery under Lapp's direction between 1965 and 1967 (Schaub and Rast  1989). Two further reports of the EDSP are to follow: one dealing with  the excavations of the EB III site of Numeira, an EB I cemetery at  Feifa, and an EB I cemetery at Khanazir; and another devoted to the  tombs excavated by the EDSP, with special attention to the human  remains. Both volumes are in progress. The present volume deals with the  data retrieved at the town site by the EDSP during seasons in 1975,  1977, 1979 and 1981. The fields excavated under Lapp's direction in 1965  are also incorporated. The inclusion of the latter was facilitated by  the fact that the EDSP has been using the same numbering and locus  system as the earlier excavations. Lapp's fields were numbered Fields  I-VII while those of the EDSP were designated Fields VIII-XIX.</p></td>
