                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>From 1969 to 1982, extensive archaeological excavations were  conducted in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem under the  direction of the late Professor Nahman Avigad. During these excavations,  impressive remains of fortifications, public buildings and domestic  dwellings were found, as well as numerous artifacts from all of the  periods of the continuous settlement of this area, beginning at the end  of the Iron Age until the Ottoman period.</p>
                  <p>Among the major  discoveries made in the course of the Jewish Quarter Excavations are  fortifications dating to the First and Second Temple periods; luxurious  residences of the Upper City of Jerusalem of the Second Temple period,  including the Palatial Mansion; the Byzantine Cardo and Nea Church; and a  gate tower of the Early Islamic period. These and other findings from  the excavation have dramatically changed our concept of the size and  topography of Jerusalem in ancient times.</p>
                  <p>Volume  I is the first of the final reports of these excavations. It presents  the architectural remains and part of the small finds from three  excavation areas: A, W, and X-2. Here were found remains of the northern  section of the First Wall that protected ancient Jerusalem's  Southwestern Hill during the First and Second Temple periods.  The  remains of these fortifications were restored following their  excavation. They are currently on display to visitors in open courtyards  and under the new buildings of the Jewish Quarter.</p>
                <p>Volume II is  the second of the final reports of these excavations. Included are  pottery, glass, metal, stone, bone, epigraphic, numismatic and incised  and painted plaster finds, among others, from three excavation areas: A,  W and X-2. These finds range in date from the end of the First Temple  period to the Late Islamic period.</p></td>
