                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>The photographic album of the archaeological excavations at Qumran  inaugurates the final presentation of the results achieved at Khirbet  Qumran and at Ain Feshkha. If the forthcoming, complete presentation of  the results has been slow in arriving, it is due to the complex nature  of the site. Few archaeological sites have raised so many questions and  excited so much interest and heated discussion, sometimes touching on  controversy. It hardly seems necessary to remind readers that the  research project at Khirbet Qumran and its environs was a mission  financed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; that the mission was  jointly led by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, whose director,  Mr. Gerald Lankester Harding, was personally involved, by the Palestine  Archaeological Museum (Rockefeller Foundation) and by the Ecole  Biblique. The American School of Oriental Research cooperated in the  exploration of the cliffs.</p>
                  <p>Roland de Vaux himself had, of course,  counted on producing the definitive publication on the work executed on  the site and its surroundings. He first gave the essentials of the  archaeological data in his preliminary reports, interwoven with an  historical framework that he wanted to test. Therefore, the most urgent  thing for him was the scrolls.</p>
                  <p>One cannot say, however, that the  archaeology of Qumran has not been published. Season after season, de  Vaux published preliminary reports in the Revue Biblique. If they were  bound together, they would form a considerable volume: 153 pages of  text, 41 photographic plates, 249 drawings of complete pottery items,  and 6 foldouts suggesting an architectural evolution. An archaeological  description of the caves appeared in the Discoveries in the Judaean  Desert series. The preliminary results were not only published but  treated perhaps even more comprehensively than in many final reports  that have appeared since, in the economic manner that sometimes seems to  prevail today. However, de Vaux would not have wanted the sum of his  work to be compared in this way. A number of scholars who were fairly  frequent visitors to the excavation also published on the subject on  different occasions: J. T. Milik, a close disciple of de Vaux, concerned  more with the history and the texts than with the site, supported his  master's conclusions as to the archaeology in 1957. E.-M. Laperrousaz  drafted with meritorious care a status quaestionis of the archaeology of  Qumran, not neglecting to give his opinion. He repeated his opinions in  a long article in a dictionary. M. Du Buit O.P., in charge of the  architectural surveys during the second and third seasons, made use of a  popular publication to express some of his ideas.</p>
                  <p>De Vaux's  preliminary reports, together with the result, of the dig as the stages  of the work unfolded, furnished first-hand documentation that bore  testimony to his intuitions and hesitations, but above all, to his  progress in understanding the intricate nature of Qumran. A few years  later, de Vaux delivered the volume of Schweich Lectures in two  versions: the French in 1961, followed by the English in 1973. This  volume was published posthumously but had been corrected by him before  his death. Therein de Vaux elaborated his thoughts, taking account of  the objections that had been aired. His sole aim had always been to try  to establish, above all else, the maximum coherence between the  archaeology of the site, the texts from the caves and the history  supplied by the coins. De Vaux's reconstruction was not always  convincing, far from it. He faced attack from various quarters:  objections were made that the connection he established between the site  and the manuscripts was not correct, that his chronology was inadequate  and, finally, that his vision of communal life lacked proof. In two  articles in the Revue Biblique, he refuted, point by point, the theses  that contradicted him. He defended his position with strong conviction  in his &quot;Esseniens ou Motes?&quot;, following a more serious challenge on some  points put forward by G. R. Driver. De Vaux crossed swords effectively  with an ardor well known to us, without departing from a rigorous  intellectual honesty. In his discussion relating to the chronology, the  link between the site and the texts, and the attribution of the remains  to the Essenes, he set out his assertions so convincingly that there was  no room for hesitation. Some uncertainties in the archaeology remained  insignificant in his view and never provided sufficient cause, however  one interpreted them, for him to alter the broad outline of his  presentation, the merit of which was not only its clarity but its great  probability. He never abandoned it.</p>
                <p>De Vaux died five years later at the height of his powers without having completed his work.</p></td>
