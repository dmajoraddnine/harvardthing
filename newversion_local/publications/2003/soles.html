                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>The island of Mochlos and the adjacent plain that lies on the coast  of Crete opposite it are located in a graben (tectonic valley) flanked  by horsts (mountain blocks) on the east and west. As a result of normal  faulting, the island and plain have experienced considerable subsidence  with respect to the areas on either side. In the Bronze Age, the two  were still connected by a narrow isthmus of land, now submerged below  sea level, that provided excellent shelter for passing ships as well as a  bridge for land traffic from the island to the adjacent coast. The  plain runs along the coast, mostly to the east of Mochlos, for a  distance of ca. 4.5 km (Fig. 1). Nowhere more than 1 km wide, it is  isolated from the interior of Crete by the Ornos Mountains, which ring  the plain on the east, west, and south, and rise abruptly to a maximum  height of 1237 m above sea level.</p>
                <p>The plain's geology consists of a  coalescing apron (20-30 m deep along the coast) of fluvial deposits  formed in the Pleistocene by torrential deposits of muds, sands,  pebbles, gravels, boulders, and other materials eroded from the  surrounding mountains.' In the Pleistocene, when sea level was much  lower, these deposits extended considerably beyond the present  coastline. Erosion of these deposits, caused primarily by the rise in  sea level that accompanied deglaciation, has resulted in the present  coastal configuration of steep vertical bluffs interrupted by narrow  ravines in which modern streams flow toward the sea. Eight of these  ravines cut through the plain to the coast, two on either side of the  headland where the modern village of Mochlos lies, directly opposite the  island, and six farther to the east. Only one ravine continues to be  fed by a freshwater stream that runs year round, the easternmost ravine  that lies at the eastern end of the coastal plain below the site of  Chalinomouri; the other stream beds are dry throughout most of the year.  Today, the area is intensively farmed. Terraces of olive trees are  planted on the mountain slopes; vineyards and wheat are grown on the  terraces along the coast; and rich gardens with bananas, pomegranates,  and other fruit trees are located in the ravines. Until recently, most  of the inhabitants in the area lived in the villages of Lastro, Sphaka,  Tourloti, and Myrsini along the main highway in the mountains above the  coast.</p></td>
