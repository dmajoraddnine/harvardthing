            <!--Applications for 2013 grants must be received at the Program office no later than <strong>January 21, 2013</strong>.   Applications received after that date will not be considered in the   current review. All application materials will become the property of   the Program and will remain confidential.</p>
            <p>The Board will make final decisions in April. Distribution of initial grants will be made in June.</p>-->The Program's geographical range includes Magna Graecia and related   cultures in the Mediterranean, Cyprus, the Iranian plateau, the Levant   (Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel), Mesopotamia, Egypt, Nubia, Sudan, and the Anatolian   peninsula. Preference is given to projects from the Neolithic to the   Medieval. The Program accepts applications only for field work   terminated for at least five years. Current and/or recent excavations   are excluded. The Program does not support dissertation research. </p>
            <p>The White Levy Program is primarily designed to fund the research   process leading directly to, but not including, publication. The Program   does not provide funds to publish final manuscripts. Grantees are   expected to arrange with their publishers for peer review of their   manuscripts before they submit the final manuscripts to the White-Levy   Program Board. Both print and digital publications are acceptable.</p>
            <p>Grantees will be required to sign a legal contract before allocation   of funds. </p>
            <p>Grants will be awarded for 1, 2 or 3 years, at the discretion of the   Board. Applicants awarded a grant may defer for only one year. If after   one year the candidate does not accept the grant, she/he must reapply.   Applicants must list other grants they are receiving in connection with   the project for which they are applying.</p>
            <p>Grantees must report to the Board annually regarding the progress of their research and the use of Program funds. Grantees are required to submit an annual report until the publication of the project. These reports are a prerequisite for additional funding and renewals. Annual Reports for current grantees are due January 7, 2013. To submit your Annual Report, <a href="annualreport.html">click here</a> OR to make a Renewal Request for more funding, <a href="renewalrequest.html">click here</a>.            </p>
            <p>Grantees whose projects are not yet completed will NOT be considered   for funding of new projects until a manuscript for the current project   has been accepted by a publisher.</p>
            <p>Program awards are given only to individuals, not to institutions.   Program funds will not be awarded to institutions or to a third party   designated as a replacement.</p>
            <p>Awards will be made up to $30,000.00 USD per grantee, per year. Each   grantee has the option either to accept the grant money personally, and   thereby to be responsible for the taxes, or to establish an account with   an institution or sponsoring agency.          </p>
