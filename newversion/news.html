            <p><strong>External Review </strong><em>(4/2013)</em><strong><br />
            </strong>The Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications (hereafter WLP) has funded 225 projects over the past 16 years, predominately in Israel, Greece, and the Near East along with some in other parts of the Mediterranean Basin and Eurasia. In order to review the program&rsquo;s successes and shortcomings, and impact on the archaeology of the Near East and neighboring areas, the WLP asked that a Review Committee prepare an External Review Report. The Review Committee was comprised of Dr. Gil J. Stein (Chair and Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology and Director of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago); Dr. Manfred Bietak (Professor of Egyptology, University of Vienna, and Director of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Cairo); and Dr. Eric Kansa (Director of Open Context, School of Information, University of California at Berkley). <a href="news/WLP_external_review.pdf">Continue to the full statement &gt;&gt;</a><br />
