Tell Jemmeh (Tel Re'im) is in the northwestern Negev desert about 10 km south of Gaza (map reference 097.088), on the southern bank of Nahal Besor (Wadi Ghazzeh). The major fieldwork for this project, directed by G. Van Beek and sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, took place from 1970-78, with smaller problem-solving exposures during 1982, 1984, 1987 and 1990. In many respects, Tell Jemmeh has become a bench-mark for non-biased field sampling methodology and remains at the forefront of total retrieval and curation of archaeological materials at historic tell sites in the southern Levant.</p>

              <p>The site of Ashdod was settled continuously from the end of the Middle Bronze period until the Arab period. During the Iron Age and the Hellenistic period both the upper and lower city were settled; in other periods only the upper city was settled. Area H can be considered the &quot;elite zone&quot; of the Early Iron Age Philistine city of Ashdod. This area exemplifies the well-planned and organized city. Some of the buildings, built on both sides of a main street, show Aegean affinities and are possibly public or &quot;high-class&quot; buildings. The finds in this area also show many Aegean affinities. Of special importance are a rich and varied assemblage of monochrome MycIIIC1b and Philistine bichrome pottery; a large group of Aegean-style anthropomorphic figurines, &quot;Philistine&quot; seals, ivories, jewelry etc.</p>

              <p>The unusually rich assemblage discovered at Tel Beersheba may serve as a basis for the analysis of the administrative, economic and ceremonial aspects of the ancient Judahite city. The proposed project will process the find and analyze the excavation results to the benefit of the scientific community. The potential of modern computerized processing methods combined with the elaborate theoretical basis of the social-archaeology paradigm assure the most fruitful result of the study of the material (Renfrew and Bahn 1991). The proposed project will concentrate on determining the administrative roles of the settlement at Tel Beersheba, as reflected by the structures and objects uncovered in each of the strata. Spatial analysis of the artifacts and ecofacts will reveal the site's economic basis regarding land cultivation, animal husbandry, and exchange. Petrographic analysis will provide data about the short- and long-distance trade contacts and will indicate the origin and scale of imported craft specialized objects. This information will be essential for the understanding of the role of Beersheba within the royal administration of Judah during the Late l0th to Early 6th centuries.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>The excavations at Tel Goren, located in the desert oasis of En-Gedi, were unique and of great importance. This isolated oasis was inhabited (aside from a Chalcolithic settlement of which a temple remains, providing an important key to understanding the culture and cult of that period) only during the end of the First Temple period and during that period apparently functioned as a royal estate of the Kings of Judah for the production of balsam. This settlement was destroyed shortly afterward by the Babylonians. The rich assemblage of finds from this period is therefore from an extremely brief and well defined period: 650-582 BCE and as such, is a chronological and cultural marker of the utmost importance. Following the destruction of the First Temple, the tell was resettled during the period of the Return to Zion (the Persian period) and was also found to have been once more a part of the new Jewish state that was established by the returned exiles. From this period as well, an exceptional architectural and ceramic assemblage emerged, including written texts. These finds are of importance in the study of the material culture of the Judean state during the late Persian period, known until now from very few excavations.</p>

              <p>Apart from the very considerable interest of the architectural succession, the great archaeological appeal of the excavations is the tight control exercised in excavation, the detailed stratigraphic sequence that resulted in a long series of independent &quot;close chronological horizons,&quot; and the systematic collection of almost all diagnostic pottery-of unprecedented value for, among other things, filling in the sparsely documented ceramic chronology of Israel, Judah, and the Hellenistic period. A small part of this stratigraphy was usefully exploited in Holladay 1990 (&quot;Red Slip, Burnish, and the Solomonic Gateway at Gezer,&quot; BASOR 277/78, pp. 23¬70).

The study of such a range of site types, including both the secular and the sacred, will contribute towards a better understanding of the socio-economic organization of arid land pastoralists as follows. First, data derived from the study of the material culture at these sites can provide information on the cultural and commercial relationships between the inhabitants of the encampments located at Hameara and Har Saggi and the population of the town of Tel Arad, the gateway to urban Palestine in the Early Bronze Age. Second, analysis and publication of this group of sites will provide information on activities carried out in domestic, burial, and ritual contexts. Third, the publication will involve submitting for testing and analysis selected material, the results of which will substantially contribute to our understanding of issues such as diet, health, and technology in the Early Bronze Age. Fourth, the location of the sites at Hameara and Har Saggi is important for reconstructing the seasonal movements of pastoral nomads during the Early Bronze Age. As part of this research sites will be entered into a geographical information system (GIS) in order to examine the distribution of various types of sites on the regional (central Negev) and interregional (southern Sinai) levels.</p>

It is mentioned several times in the Bible (Torah), the Books of the Maccabees and Josephus Flavius. Since the Persian period (6th-4th c. BCE), it was the main city of Idumea/Western Edom, south of Judea, and it owes its fame and prosperity to its location on the main routes from the East to the Levantine coast (Ascalon, Gaza; part of the perfume road), and from Egypt to Syria. It also produced oil on an industrial scale and most probably also cereals. It had a political role in the frame of the relations between the Levantine ethnies and the central powers, mainly the Greco-Macedonian ones in the Hellenistic Period. </p>

This particular section of the road was an essential part of the Nabatean trade route and constitutes a missing link in our knowledge of the subject.

              <p>Tel Nagila is a multi-period site situated on the western bank of Nahal Shiqma in the southern coastal plain. The most intensive occupation occurred during the Middle Bronze Age IIB-C period, when a fortified city occupied the site. A section excavated on the northeast side of the tell revealed an elaborate rampart system made up of an earthen embankment with a mudbrick wall perched atop it. Various layers of earth and crushed chalk were laid against the wall to form a glacis. The mudbrick wall was found to continue above this glacis and a mudbrick tower was integrated into it. Four to five strata dating to the MBIIB-C were unearthed at the center of the mound, including a residential quarter and parts of two public buildings. The plan of the settlement reveals systematic planning of the residential quarter along a series of parallel streets, with other streets intersecting at right angles. The finds include pottery (including tens of complete vessels), a number of scarabs, ostrich eggshells used as vessels, metal objects and a unique ceramic zoomorphic vessel. Of particular interest is a sherd with a fragmentary, two-line Proto-Canaanite inscription. Two rock-cut tombs were found south of the tell, near the riverbank. The first is a small tomb dating to the Early Bronze Age II or III. The second dates to the MBIIB-C and is made up of three chambers containing the remains of 50 individuals, 150 pottery vessels, Egyptian alabaster and faience vessels, 48 scarabs and bronze objects.</p>

Excavated with fully modern methods, and the basis for much of modern theory, these materials are even more significant in some ways than when they were first brought to light a generation ago. Yet only a small proportion of the basic data has been published, and these only in preliminary reports.

            <h3>The Islamic Period in Ramla</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p>In recent decades the field of Islamic archaeology has gained in importance and the study of various aspects of the material culture has begun. Hence, next to the unearthing of desert castles and the residences of Muslim rulers, the glazed ceramics they used have attracted the attention of different scholars, also because of their beauty (One of the most outstanding books about Muslim ceramics is Jean Soustiel's La Céramique Islamique, Le Guide du Connaisseur. Fribourg. 1985). However, Islamic archaeology is still in its infancy, especially regarding aspects of daily life. More and more sites associated with the Islamic periods have been the object of excavation projects: Elia (Jerusalem), Taburiyye (Tiberias), Qaimun (Yokne'am), 'Akko (Acre) and of course also at Ramla. Ramla has traditionally been associated by Christian pilgrims with St Helena and a large cistern known as Bir el-Aneziye. </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Safadi and Abu Matar, excavated during ten years, have provided the main part of our knowledge concerning what is commonly designed as the &quot;Beersheba Culture&quot;. These sites, as well as Shiqmim, 20km west from Beersheba, have revealed settlements of an ancient agro-pastoral civilization in what is now the semi-arid northern Negev. The study of these settlements offers a good opportunity to reconsider the development of South Near East at the turn of the 4th millennium, from a technical, socio-economical, anthropological and cultural point of view. The project submitted here is to produce a precise study of the architecture from Safadi and Abu Matar. It intends to analyse the stratigraphic sequences of both sites and then the various ways the dwellings were built as well as the organization of the settlements. A comparative study between the dwellings from Abu Matar and Safadi will be made. Their results will be compared to the neighbouring sites of Shiqmim and K. el Bitar.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>This grant proposal is for the analysis and preparation for final publication of the data collected during my 11 years of excavation (1989-90, 1996-2004) at the 8,000-year-old Neolithic site of Sha'ar Hagolan. The site is located in the central Jordan Valley of Israel, 1.5 miles south of the Sea of Galilee, and is the type-site for the Yarmukian culture, which occupied large parts of Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. The excavations have opened new horizons for our understanding of the Neolithic period, but also have more far-reaching implications for the entire ancient Near East in terms of history of architecture, urban planning, art history and cult. The Pottery Neolithic period, previously considered to be an era of decline, has proved to be a time of cultural evolution in the Levant.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>This proposal seeks support to prepare a book-length publication concerning the Phase II excavations at Shiqmim, the largest and most deeply stratified Chalcolithic (ca. 4500 - 3500 BCE) site in Israel's Negev desert. The major field work for this project took place in 1987 -1989 and was sponsored by the Nelson Glueck School of Biblical Archaeology (NGSBA) of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Jerusalem.  In many respects, Shiqmim has become a bench-mark for social evolutionary studies in the southern Levant. </p>

<h2>Yarmuth (MichaEl Jasmin, 2005)</h2>
<h3>A monograph on the excavation of the acropolis of Tel Yarmuth in Israel from the Early Bronze Age to the Byzantine period<br />
  (XXVIIth century BC - IVth century AD)</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Tel Yarmuth acropolis provides the unique opportunity to study a site on the longue durée, with a quasi continuous occupation covering more than thirty centuries from the XXVIIth BC (Early Bronze Age) to the IVth AD (Byzantine period). It is usually thought that only major regional sites knew long continuous occupation. Tel Yarmuth is an original and instructive example: it shows clearly that after the impressive Early Bronze city, the renewed occupation on a village scale on the upper tell lasted for two millennia. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dramatic discovery was made in 2002 at Yavneh, Israel, a Tell close to the Mediterranean coast (roughly 25 km south of Tel Aviv). The salvage excavation was made after bulldozers hit an ancient site on top of a hill north of the Tell during gardening works. This hill is unofficially (but amply) called &quot;the temple hill&quot; since the 1960s. Excavation revealed a repository pit (favissa in Latin or Genizah in Hebrew) with thousands of temple objects. In the pit there were thousands of broken chalices (cup-like vessels) and bowls, many showing traces of burning, probably from use as incense burners. We also found fire pans— a type of Aegean incense vessel never before encountered in Israel/Palestine; some large round offering vessels (thymeteria) and several altars of various shapes. The most startling finds were 120 cultic stands, rich with figures of humans, plants and animals. These are crucial for understanding Philistine art and religion from a period, which left almost no written sources (c. 9th century BC). It is a spectacular discovery, being the richest and best-preserved repository pit even found in the southern Levant. The finds from the pit also shed light on the use of incense in the cult and on 'western' features in Philistine material culture.</p>

<h2>Ziklag / Tel Sera (Eliezer Oren, 2001) </h2>
<h3>The Publication of Tel Sera': The Bronze Age Strata (Area A), Israel</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Identified with Biblical Ziklag - King David's city of refuge, Tel Sera' is located on the north bank of Nahal Gerar, ca. 7 km upstream from Tel Haror and about 18 km east of Gaza. This region with its dense cluster of major Bronze and Iron Age tells (ancient Gaza, Tell el-Ajjul, Tell Far'a, Tell Jemmeh, Tel Haror, Tel Sera' etc.) played significantly in the political, cultural and economic history of Canaan, i.e., intensive contacts with Egypt, widespread Philistine settlement, Assyrian administration on the border of Egypt, etc. Large-scale excavations from 1972 to 1978 by Ben-Gurion University expedition under the direction of E.D. Oren uncovered the rich settlement assemblages (strata I -XIII), with some gaps in habitation, from the Chalcolithic through the Byzantine periods. The results of the excavations contribute significantly to the study of political history and cultural exchanges with Egypt as well as to certain pivotal issues in the chronology of the Bronze and Iron Ages in Canaan. Tel Sera' played importantly in the settlement history and economy of the western Negev, particularly during the Hyksos period (Middle Bronze Age III), the period of Egyptian domination (Late Bronze Age II-III), the Philistine (Iron Age I) and Assyrian period (Iron Age III). The proposed publication project will focus on the rich settlement strata XII-IX, from the Middle Bronze Age III to Late Bronze III, ca. 1600-1150 BCE.</p>
