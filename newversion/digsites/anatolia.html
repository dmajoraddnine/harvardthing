            <h2>Arslantepe (Federico Manuelli, 2008) </h2>
            <h3>The Eastern Anatolian societies during the Late Bronze Age (1650 — 1200 B.C.). The Hittite influence at Arslantepe — Malatya (Turkey) and in the Upper Euphrates Valley as seen from pottery production</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The topic of the book regards the analysis of the remarkable unpublished ceramic assemblages of the Late Bronze Age found at Arslantepe, Malatya, as well as their comparisons with the pottery production from other sites in the Upper Euphrates Valley, and with the materials from the Hittite centres in Central Anatolia. Arslantepe, the lions hill, is the ancient Hittite city of Melid. The mound is located in Eastern Turkey, to the right of the Euphrates, in the district of Malatya, and is considered the most important site of the area. Arslantepe pottery is an ideal source of information for observing the possible changes occurred in the local production in connection with the increasing Hittite pressure in the region and on the site. The study and its publication will greatly enhance our knowledge of the social, political and economic organization of the Eastern Anatolian area during the Late Bronze Age period</p>

            <h2>Aphrodisias (R.R.R. Smith, 2001) </h2>
            <h3> Roman Sculpture from Aphrodisias in Caria</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The excavations at Aphrodisias (SW Turkey), conducted by Prof. Kenan Erim from 1961 to 1990, produced large quantities of high-quality marble sculpture of the Roman period. The current Aphrodisias Project, sponsored by the Institute of Fine Arts and New York University, is focused in large part on the documentation and publication of these earlier excavations and their associated finds. This grant is within that project and concerns two major bodies of material, the reliefs from the Sebasteion and the portrait sculpture of the site. Both have been studied in preparatory journal articles by the applicant, and their full monographic publication is now a priority. The historical significance of this material is high. The Sebasteion reliefs are a remarkable visualization of the Roman emperors as seen from the Greek provinces, and the portrait sculpture provides a near-complete repertoire from a single city of the changing self-representation of the kind of men and women who ran the eastern Roman empire. This material has detailed contexts, and it is material that makes a difference.</p>

            <h2>Troy (Ernst Pernicka, 2010)</h2>
            <h3>Das bronzezeitliche Troia, Ausgrabungen und Forschungen 1988-2005 (Bronze Age Troy, Excavations and Research 1988-2005)</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The site today known as Troy (Turkish Hisarlik, Homer's Ilios, Greek and RomanIlion/Ilium) is situated in northwestern Asia Minor, five kilometers from the present coastline at the Dardanelles (ancient Hellespont), at 26°14´E and 39°52´N. Its sequence of occupation spans several millennia from the beginning of the Bronze Age (3000 BC) to the Byzantine period (12th century AD). Troy's high profile is obviously due to the fact that it has been regarded as the scene of the Trojan War, a story told in Homer's Iliad and still part of popular culture. In the course of an exceptionally long history of research, beginning with Heinrich Schliemann's excavations during the 19th century, Troy - its mythological or literary associations notwithstanding - has become an important archaeological site in its own right. This is only partly due to the attention and research that have gone into the investigation of the site. With its unique, continuous sequence of settlements spanning the entire Bronze Age, Troy is certainly one of the most prominent archaeological sites in Anatolia and the Aegean.</p>
