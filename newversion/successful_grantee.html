      <p><strong>A.	PERSONAL PAYMENT<br />
        </strong>Accept the grant money personally and be responsible for any accrued taxes. United States citizens are reminded to file both federal and state income tax forms. If non-United States citizens select this option they are reminded to file appropriate tax forms in their country. Non-United States citizens who conduct their research within the United States will be subject to a 30% or more withholding tax in addition to whatever taxes their own government requires. Grantees are allowed to use grant funds to pay taxes on the awarded money.

<h3>Second Year Funding</h3>
<p>In order to make sure that you and your team have funds to support your work during the summer months, a three-month &quot;bridging grant&quot; will be issued on June 15th (to cover July, August, and September).  This bridging grant will comprise the first quarter of your 2nd year of funding. In order to receive the remainder of your funding, you must submit an <a href="annualreport.html">annual report</a> by August 1st. The Board will review the report and approve or deny it at their September meeting. If approved, a second check will then be issued on October 1, disbursing the remaining 9 months of the grant.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Third Year Funding</h3>
<p>An <a href="annualreport.html">annual report</a> on your project is due in January along with updated publication information. You will receive funding after a successful review of your status report.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<h3>Continued Reporting</h3>
<p>You are required to submit an annual report every year until your project is published. </p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
