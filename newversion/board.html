                <p>Leon Levy was not only a   distinguished financier, but also a well-informed and generous patron of   the arts. Archaeology benefited in a special way from his munificence.   He supported many aspiring scholars of the arts and archaeology, as well   as institutional projects, in these areas. The White Levy Program for   Archaeological Publications was one of his favorite undertakings. He was   well aware of the importance of publishing the results of   archaeological excavations. His numerous philanthropies will go on under the   direction of his spouse, Shelby White, also President of the White Levy   Program, who has assured the Board that this Program will continue to be   supported. Leon used to say, somewhat facetiously, the two loves of his   life were making money and then giving it away. Countless recipients of   his largesse can attest especially to the second. </p></td>
