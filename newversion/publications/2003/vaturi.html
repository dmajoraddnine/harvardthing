                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>Vounous is the name of a low hill overlooking the sea on the north  coast of Cyprus (Fig. 1). It is situated one and a half miles east of  the Abbey of Bellapais, which is one of the chief tourist attractions of  the island. The site, located in the northern foothills of the Kyrenia  range, is a large prehistoric Bronze Agel cemetery. Vounous was  initially mentioned by Professor Gjerstad under the heading Kasafani.  Its tombs were looted in the early 1930's and the Department of  Antiquities was alerted of the sale of Red Polished vases at Kyrenia.  Porphyros Dikaios, Curator of the Cyprus Museum, undertook the rescue  excavations at Vounous in 1931-1932. P. Dikaios uncovered Tombs 1 to 48  in the western part of the site. In June 1933, Claude F. A. Schaeffer,  representing the National Museums of France, excavated Tombs 49 to 79 in  the same area, in collaboration with P. Dikaios (Fig. 2). An expedition  of the British School at Athens, directed by James R. Stewart,  continued the excavations in 1937-1938. Tombs 80 to 164 were uncovered  at both sites A and B. All of them conducted unsuccessful field research  around the site in order to find a settlement connected to the  necropolis.</p>
                  <p>In 1956, Professor J.R. Stewart obtained an agreement  from C.F.A. Schaeffer to undertake the publication of his (Schaeffer's)  excavations at Bellapais Vounous as the report in extenso remained  unpublished. The documents from Schaeffer's season available to J.R.  Stewart and his student, R.S. Merrillees - who completed his Archaeology  III thesis on &quot;Vounous Tombs 49 to 79&quot; in 1959 at Sydney University -  were comprised of the manuscript notebooks restricted to the contents of  the tombs, photographs of the tombs, and Schaeffer's book Missions en  Chypre. It was only a few years later, in 1961, that more documents -  and not the least: in situ plans and sections drawn by Dikaios and  prepared for publication, and Dikaios's notebookg all in pencil - on the  1933 excavations were given to them. These important sources of  information implied a revision of R.S. Merrillees' thesis that he never  brought to the state of publication, encouraging &quot;any qualified student  or scholar to finalize this long overdue undertaking&quot;.</p>
                  <p>NOTES EXPLANATORY TO THE CATALOGUE</p>
                  <p>The  present report was written from copies of the original catalogue cards  and notes made by J.R. Stewart and R.S. Merrillees. It is no easy matter  to undertake the publication of another archaeologist's excavations,  particularly those in which one has had no part. Inevitably there must  be gaps in the treatment of the following tomb groups, but it seems more  than indispensable to finally reveal the material unearthed some 70  years ago. Tombs 49 to 79 are discussed in detail further on, including  tomb plans when available; the plates have been organised by tomb groups  in order to give an overall picture. We have followed Schaeffer's  numbering system instead of Stewart's to designate the tombs. The number  of the tomb alone refers to the Main Chamber, whereas a letter in lower  case (a or b) added to the number of the tomb indicate that it is a  Side Chamber. JR. Stewart applied his own system to the Vounous tombs as  a whole which is confusing as he used letters in upper case in order to  differentiate each chamber, for example 50 A (Main Chamber), 50 B (Side  Chamber a) and 50 C (Side Chamber b).</p>
                <p>The human remains have been  drawn on the in situ plans but no skeletal material was apparently kept  because of their bad state of preservation as early excavators in  Cyprus found skeletons of little academic interest. Only four skulls,  one of the most likely parts of the body to be preserved, have been  recorded in the Field Registers. Animal bones are also only occasionally  reported in the course of the excavations and no identification was  carried out post-excavation on the material.</p></td>
