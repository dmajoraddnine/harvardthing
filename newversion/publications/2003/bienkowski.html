                  <p>In  this final report on the late Mrs. Bennett's excavations, Piotr  Bienkowski and specialist contributors describe and illustrate the  architecture, stratigraphy, pottery and other finds in detail. The  concluding chapter revises accepted ideas of Busayra's date, nature and  role and assesses the site in its proper ancient context in the light of  current research on tribal kingdoms. Busayra was settled from the late  eighth century to c. 300/200 BC, with some reuse, perhaps for  agricultural purposes, in the Nabataean and Roman periods. It is ideally  located on an easily defended, high spur among rich arable lands,  providing secure opportunities for agriculture and pastoralism and  maximizing proximity to the copper mines of Faynan and to the crossing  of the Wadi Arabah used by the Arabian incense trade. Piotr Bienkowski  concludes that Busayra was not a capital of a nation state, as it is  often described, but the administrative and religious centre of the  supratribal authority of the heterarchical state of Edom, recognized and  treated as kings by the Assyrians.</p>
