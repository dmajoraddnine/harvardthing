                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>This is the fourth volume on the results of the excavations directed  by the late Professor Nahman Avigad in the years 1969-1982 at the Jewish  Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.  The first two volumes on these excavations (<em>Jewish Quarter</em> I, II)  dealt with Areas A, W and X-2, including remains of the Broad Wall, the  Israelite Tower, and the First Wall, all fortifications dating to the  First and Second Temple periods. These are located in the northern part  of the Jewish Quarter, in areas that had been included within the city's  fortified area by the end of the First Temple Period (<em>Jewish Quarter</em> I, II). The third volume presents the results of excavations in Area E,  where remains of private dwellings from the time of Herod the Great  were exposed; they were shown to have been put into disuse when a  stone-paved street was constructed over them (<em>Jewish Quarter</em> III).  These three volumes also included studies of specific artifact  assemblages from the Jewish Quarter excavations, including various seal  impressions and Hebrew and Aramaic inscriptions of the First and Second  Temple periods, glass production waste from the beginning of the  Herodian period, and stone scale weights of the late Second Temple  period, among others. </p>
                <p>This volume presents the remains and  artifacts discovered in Area B, at the eastern end of the Jewish  Quarter, opposite the Temple Mount and Western Wall on the other side of  the Tyropoeon Valley. Remains of four settlement strata were found  there, dating from the end of the First Temple period (Stratum 4), the  late Second Temple period (Strata 3 and 2), and the Byzantine period up  to the late Mamluk/early Ottoman period (Stratum 1). The most important  of these remains is a residential structure that has come to be known as  the Burnt House (Stratum 2). It consists of a small courtyard with a  number of rooms, a kitchen, and a <em>miqweh</em>, but was clearly part of  a larger structure that extended beyond the limits of the excavation.  The house was constructed around the beginning of the 1st century CE and  destroyed in a conflagration during the period of the ROman conquest  and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In the rooms of the Burnt House  were found fragments of dozens of ceramic and stone vessels and hundreds  of other finds of different types, buried under layers of charred  wooden beams and collapsed stone walls. These remains were remarkably  well preserved, lying buried for 1,900 years under layers of later  construction. The building and the finds are of particular significance  to the archaeological research of the late Second Temple period.  Furthermore, the excavation of the house marked the first time in which  clear and tangible evidence for the Roman destruction of Jerusalem was  recovered. Evidence was also encountered for the name of the house's  owner, which appears engraved on a stone weight: &quot;belonging to] the son  of Qatros.&quot; This was a priestly family that lived in the Upper City of  Jerusalem, known from Jewish written sources relating to the Second  Temple period. </p></td>
