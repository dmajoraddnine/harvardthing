                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>This volume presents the results of the excavations of Areas H and K  in the 1968 and 1969 seasons, and is the sixth and final volume of the  Ashdod series. Regrettably, this publication appears more than thirty  five years after the end of excavations. The work on the volume was  initiated by Moshe Dothan, assisted by Marina Popovitz, during the early  1990s, but due to Dothan 's illness and his passing away in 1999, the  work was suspended. Towards the end of 1999, with the encouragement of  Trude Dothan, the aid of the Israel Antiquities Authority, and a  generous grant from the White-Levy Program for Archaeological  Publications, work on the material was resumed. The final stages toward  the completion of the volume were carried out during the years  2000-2002. Amihai Mazar, area supervisor in the 1968-1969 seasons,  prepared the draft of the stratigraphic report on Area H, Strata XIV-X.  Subsequently, the plans, drawings and photographs were revised and the  text was completed. The results of the 1968 season of excavations in  Area K, which is adjacent to and inseparable from Area H, were added to  the report. </p>
                  <p>Though the format of the previous  volumes of the Ashdod publication was generally followed, several  changes were introduced in order to adapt a more modern format and new  technologies. Thus, this volume is published in the larger format of the  IAA Reports. As the work on the volume continued through an extensive  period, there are some minor incongruities in the style of drawings,  photographs and plans. Some of the field photographs could not be  located and some of the documentation needed to be partly restored  (particularly field sections). </p>
                  <p>Several groups of finds  were entrusted to specialists and are described in their respective  chapters: jewelryÂ­A. Golani and D. Ben-Shlomo: flints-Z. Matskevich;  scarabs-O. Keel and S. Monger; coins-D.T. Ariel; and animal bones-E.  Maher. The burial, analyzed by E. Dueitch, appears in the stratigraphic  report. </p>
                  <p>The plans and sections were prepared for  publication by draftsmen of the Israel Antiquities Authority, Natalia  Zak and Elizabeth Belashov. Recent drawings and amendments are by Noga  Ze'evi and Marina Zeltzer. Photographs of the finds from the 1980s  onward are by Tsila Sagiv and Clara Amit, while the earlier photos of  the finds were taken by Ze'ev Radovan. Ella Altmark cleaned and restored  some of the metal finds. </p>
                  <p>Though this is the final volume  describing the excavations at Tel Ashdod, large quantities of material,  coming from poor or unstratified contexts and surveys, chiefly from  Areas G, K and M, remain as yet unpublished. Hopefully, at least the  most important of these finds will soon be published elsewhere. </p>
