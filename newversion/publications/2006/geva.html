                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>This is the third volume on the results of the excavations directed  by the late Professor Nahman Avigad in the years 1969-1982 at the Jewish  Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The first two volumes on these  excavations (Jewish Quarter I, II) dealt with Areas A, W and X-2, the  prominent remains of which are First and Second Temple period  fortifications located on the northern side of the Southwestern Hill.  These volumes also included studies on all the First Temple period seal  impressions and imported Greek stamped amphora handles from the  Hellenistic period found throughout the Jewish Quarter excavation areas. </p>
                  <p>The present volume focuses on the findings from Area E, located  in the center of the Jewish Quarter. The area yielded finds from six  occupational strata ranging from the Iron Age II to the Late Roman and  Byzantine periods. The most significant of these are the strata from the  late Second Temple period, specifically the second half of the 1st  century BCE. Prominent architectural remains from this period are a  group of well-preserved structures, which contained a variety of finds  (Stratum 3), put into disuse and sealed by the massive stone pavement of  a street (Stratum 2). The importance of the finds contained within the  structures lies in the fact that they were deposited in a clear  stratigraphical context that can be well dated to a brief and defined  period of time during the reign of Herod the Great. </p>
                  <p>The remains from the Second Temple period can contribute much to  the understanding of the nature and chronology of the establishment of  the wealthy residential quarter of the Upper City, and to the  classification of pottery and stone vessel forms, as well as other  finds, in use in Jerusalem during Herod's reign.       Part One of this report includes seventeen chapters. The first  chapter describes the architectural remains uncovered in Area E,  presented according to stratum. The second chapter discusses uniquely  shaped stone basins of the Second Temple period used for washing feet  before descent into miqwa'ot for immersion; two of these basins were  found in Area E, one in situ. The other chapters in Part One present the  variety of small finds found in different strata of Area E. An index of  the Area E finds is brought at the end of Part One. Part Two of the  report contains five chapters dealing with several types of small finds  from the Second Temple period uncovered in excavation areas throughout  the Jewish Quarter: stone scale weights, Hebrew and Aramaic ostraca, and  the refuse of a glass workshop. Also appearing in the second part are  supplementary studies on various finds from the excavations. </p>
                  <p>Our plan is to continue in the coming years with the publication  of the principal findings from the Jewish Quarter excavations. The  fourth volume, which is being prepared by Oren Gutfeld, will deal with  the findings from Areas X (the Byzantine Cardo) and T (the Nea Church).  The fifth volume will be devoted to the findings from Area B (the Burnt  House). To be published subsequently are the remains of the elaborate  dwellings of the wealthy residential quarter-the Upper City of the late  Second Temple period (also referred to as the Herodian  Quarter)-uncovered in Areas F, M, and P of the Jewish Quarter.         The present volume could not have been effectively realized  without the assistance of numerous scholars, from research institutions  both in Israel and abroad. They are appreciated for offering their time,  knowledge and expertise on behalf of the publication of the wealth of  finds unearthed in Area E and in other areas of the Jewish Quarter. Some  of these scholars had already taken part in the study of Jewish Quarter  finds published in the previous two volumes. Our thanks go to all of  them for their invaluable contribution, and we hope that our rewarding  partnership with them will continue in the future. </p>
                  <p>We would like to express our thanks and appreciation to the  foundations that supported the publication of this volume: The Donna and  Marvin Schwartz Foundation, The Dorot Foundation, The Reuben and Edith  Hecht Trust, and George Blumenthal and the Center for Online Judaic  Studies. The research and the editing of the chapters on the Hebrew and  Aramaic ostraca were supported by The David and Jemima Jeselsohn  Epigraphic Center of Jewish History at Bar-Ilan University.           We are also grateful to all who participated in the excavation  and in the processing of the finds and the           publication of this volume. Our thanks go to the Israel  Exploration Society and its director, Joseph Aviram, for his  encouragement and efforts in pushing the publication of the Jewish  Quarter excavations forward, and his help in obtaining necessary  financial support for the publication of previous volumes and the  present volume; to the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University  of Jerusalem on Mt. Scopus, where the Jewish Quarter excavation's finds  are stored and where their processing and study takes place, and whose  laboratories were of great assistance in the preparation of finds for  publication; and to the Israel Antiquities Authority (the Department of  Antiquities and Museums at the time of the excavation), a trusted  partner during the excavation, and in whose laboratories the pottery  vessels were restored and the metal vessels were treated at the  conclusion of the excavation. </p>
                  <p>We offer special thanks to those who have assisted over the years  in bringing this volume to fruition in accord with the high standards  set for the publication. Ben Gordon worked diligently on the translation  of some chapters of the book to English, and on the final editing of  the book, seeing it through to its final publication. Alan Paris and  Shelly Sadeh translated and edited several of the chapters. Alan Paris  also offered helpful advice in preparing the manuscript for publication.  Gabi Laron took the color photographs of the finds. Oren Gutfeld  assisted in preparing the stratigraphy chapter. Ravit Nenner-Soriano  worked meticulously and devotedly on the registration of the finds and  the production of publication-ready plates. We extend our thanks also to  all those who have participated, over the years since the close of the  excavations, in the drawing and photographing of the finds and in their  preparation for publication (a full list of these individuals appears in  Chapter One, this volume). Also deserving of mention for their tireless  efforts are Arieh Marzel, who typeset the manuscript, and Avraham  Pladot of the Old City Press, who harnessed his talent and expertise for  the sake of the book, preparing its illustrations and page layout,  supervising its printing, and essentially seeing the book through to the  final form laid before you. </p>
