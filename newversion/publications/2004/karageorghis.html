                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>The publication of this final Volume VI of the excavations at Kition,  on the Phoenician and later levels, has been delayed for various  reasons outlined below. The importance of the mate­rial, however, has  not been diminished. For four hundred years the history of Cyprus was  dominated by the presence of the Phoenicians on the island. This period  coincided with the full development and the end of the Cypriote kingdoms  for which archaeology is, up to now. one of the principal sources of  information. The archaeological material from Kition, combined with the  rich harvest of inscriptions which this site has yielded, is an  indispensable tool for research into the political, social and cultural  life on the island of Cyprus . Amathus and Idalion are the two other  sites where archaeological research is still going on and which will  provide valuable additional material relating to the role of the  Phoenicians in Cyprus. The publication of the results of these  excavations, especially of the epigraphically rich material recently  dis­covered at Idalion, will contribute considerably. I wish we had a  fuller report on the ten years of excavations at Tamassos. </p>
                  <p>It  was decided that the best way to proceed with the publication of Kition  VI would be the initial publication of a volume of plates for the  objects. This demanded the transfer of many objects from the Larnaca  District Museum for photography and drawing, a time-consuming task. With  the help of Dr. Maria Hadjicosti, who participated in the excavations  at Kition and Yiannis Hadjisavvas, who accumulated vast experience  working with me for the preparation of plates of all my previous  excavations, we produced this volume in 1999. This, I realize <em>post eventum</em>,  was not a correct decision. 1 had not personally gone through all the  material, which was handled by a number of young archaeologists who  acted as assistants at the time of the excavation. Thus, inevitably, a  number of mistakes were made, especially in the numbering of objects,  which I discovered only while writing up the text for Part II of Vol.  VI, which dealt with the inventoried objects and which was printed in  2003. Its preparation had already started in 1999, but for various  reasons the actual printing had to be delayed. This erroneous procedure  resulted in the many corrigenda in the volume of plates. The  responsibility, however, is entirely mine, and nobody else's. In the  preface to the volume I acknowledged the help which I received from a  number of people. </p>
                  <p>The preparation of Part 1 of this  volume started in 2003. It comprises the study of the architectural  remains from the earliest Phoenician temples to the residential  buildings of the Roman period (Floors 3. 2A, 2, 1, C, B and A), as well  as the problem of the chronology and some general remarks. For the study  of the architectural remains I had, as for Vol. V the valuable  assistance of Olivier Callot, who studied Temple 1 (Floors 3, 2A and 2).  His study is published as Chapter II 1 in this volume, with his own  drawings and plans. I am very grateful to him, although as I mention in  my text, I do not entirely agree with his reconstruction of the temple;  but 1 find his suggestions very ingenious. </p>
                  <p>In the  preliminary publication (Karageorghis 1976), as well as in Kition II and  III, which dealt with the Egyptian and Egyptianizing objects and the  Phoenician inscriptions respectively, I used a chronology which was very  tentative. It was only later, with the meticulous study of the  Phoenician pottery from Kition by Patricia Bikai and the Black-on-Red  wares by Nicola Schreiber that the new chronology of the material became  more precise. Thus, in view of the new evidence, I had to revise the  chronology which I suggested previously. I express my apologies to those  who have been using the old Kition chronology since 1976. I must say,  however, that I have not changed my ideas regarding the first appearance  of the Phoenicians at Kition in the second half of the 9th century B.C. </p>
                <p>Part II of Vol. VI comprises a large number of  appendices written by experts, which are most valuable for the  understanding of a number of specific groups of objects, ceramics,  seals, coins, lamps etc. May they all find here the expression of my  gratitude and my apologies for the long delay which occurred before  their studies appeared in print. This delay, as explained above, is not  entirely my fault. </p></td>
