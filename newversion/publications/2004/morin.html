                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>The site of Khostia, located approximately 60 km West-South-West                of Thebes, about one km inland above the coast of the Gulf of  Korinthos               (fig.1.1), lies at an altitude of 200 meters  above sea level upon a flattened area and surrounding                slopes near the end of a rocky spur advancing Southwards from the                base of Mount Helikon's Palaiovouno massif, from which it is  separated               by a shallow saddle. For most of its existence,  the settlement appears               to have been a small town or a  village, although it had the status               of a city during the  Hellenistic period, since the diagnostic remains               visible  on its surface, including those dated to prehistoric times,                extend over an area of around 4.45 hectares (Fossey, 1981: 12);                this surface area corresponds to the maximum extent reached by  the               site during the long history of its occupation. During  the Bronze               Age the settlement extended probably over only  part of this area.</p>
                  <p>The site has been known for a long time, but  has been only sparingly               visited by scholars, following  Leake's report at the beginning of               the 19th century  (Fossey, 1981: 1 &amp; 11); commentaries about               it are few  and generally brief. Gomme (1911-12: 205), Frazier (1913:                V.134) and Philippson &amp; Kirsten (1951: 456) signal its location,                while Philippson &amp; Kirsten (1951: 687) also mention the  presence               there of Middle Helladic material. The earliest  study, itself relatively               short, devoted specifically to  the ruins visible on the surface               of the Kastron is due to  Busing &amp; Busing (1972: 74-87). The               only well preserved  remains belong exclusively to the historical               period  (Hellenistic to Late Roman); they consist of an important                circuit wall enclosing most of the settled area. The few wall segments                surviving to any appreciable height explain the modern  toponym of               Kastron, specifically Kastron Khostion, the &quot;<em>kastron</em> of Khostia&quot;               usually applied to it locally. Fossey (1981:  passim, especially               62-70 and figs 15-21; 1988: 187-194)  provides a detailed description               of the architectural  features of the circuit. These walls, as well               as a limited  amount of literary and epigraphic documents relevant               to  the historical city, have been the main focus of interest for                most scholars until now and have allowed them to equate the site                with the small Boiotian city of Khorsiai (for the main  bibliography               of the site see Fossey, 1988: 188; see also  Roesch, 1965: 56-58,               and Roesch, 1970).</p>
                  <p>Prehistoric  remains visible on the surface present an even more               modest  picture of the settlement than the historical period, since                the only signs of human activity at the site during the Bronze Age                are limited to sherds. The sequence of Bronze Age activity  on the               site was first established by Heurtley (1923-25:  42); the compilations               of Hope-Simpson (1965: 123 no. 420)  and Hope-Simpson and Dickinson               (1979: 250, G36)  essentially reiterate the same data. Fossey (1988)               has  published a more complete sequence based, in part, on his own                observations of surface material, as well as on the preliminary                study of material excavated in 1980 and 1983 (Fossey, 1981;  Fossey &amp; Morin, 1986; Fossey, 1988:187-193; Fossey &amp; Morin,  1989).               The present study constitutes the end product of  the survey and               the two excavation seasons.<br />
