                <td width="712" valign="top"><p>The extensive history of excavations at Megiddo (Tell el-Mutesellim)                attests to the site's cultural and historical significance  and effectively               chronicles the disciplinary development  of archaeological research               in the region. Virtually every  generation has left its mark, and               a vast portion of the  site has been excavated in the process. This               is  particularly true of Stratum VI. While this report is primarily                concerned with the results of the Oriental Institute excavations,                any attempt to reconstruct the stratum, and the cultural  and historical               information that it contains, must  incorporate the results of other               projects that have  excavated at the site as well. Consequently,               this chapter  surveys the history of excavations of Stratum VI at                Megiddo with the aim of assembling a composite record of those projects                that have produced published remains of Stratum VI.</p>
                <p>The  medieval Jewish writer Estori Ha-Parhi is credited with being                the first explorer to link ancient Megiddo to the Arab village of                Lejjun (Ha-Parhi 1976: 293), located at the entrance to the  Wadi               Ara, just to the south of the mounded tell (fig. 1).  In the mid-nineteenth               century, the biblical scholar  Edward Robinson, aware that the Sixth               Roman Legion had  been stationed near Megiddo, and influenced by               the  etymological link between the Arabic &quot;Lejjun&quot; and               the  Latin &quot;Legio,&quot; reasserted its association with the               ancient  site (Robinson and Smith 1841/3: 177-80). Remarkably, during                a subsequent trip Robinson actually visited Tell el-Mutesellim and                was struck by the exceptional view but failed to recognize  that               he was standing on the ruins of the ancient  settlement (Robinson               and Smith 1856: 117). Robinson's  claim that Megiddo was located               at Lejjun was vigorously  contested by Claude R. Conder, who argued               instead that the  remains of the famous town were located at Khirbet                Mujedda), a site in the hills overlooking the southeastern comer                of the Jezreel Valley (Conder and Kitchener 1882:  64-66,70,90-99).               The ensuing debate was resolved about a  decade later by the eminent               geographer George Adam Smith,  who argued convincingly in favor of               the ruins preserved at  Tell el-Mutesellim (1892: 385-87).</p></td>
