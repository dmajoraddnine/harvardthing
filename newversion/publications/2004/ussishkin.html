                  THE STORY OF THE EXPEDITION</p>
                  <p><br />
                    In  1971 I commenced planning for a long-term, systematic excavation,                to be carried out by the newly established Institute of  Archaeology               of Tel Aviv University, and began seeking an  important mound of               the biblical period. At that time the  Institute conducted a single,               major excavation project at  Tel Beer-Â­Sheba under the aegis               of its Director, Yohanan  Aharoni. Not having at my disposal the               means to start the  excavation I planned, I sought to establish a               partnership  with other members of the Institute, to no avail. The               time  for joint archaeological projects in Israel was not yet ripe.</p>
                <p>Unable  to convince other colleagues in the Institute of my designs,                I decided to carry on alone. In 1971-1972 I spent a sabbatical leave                in London. There I visited Richard Barnett, then Keeper  of Western               Asiatic Antiquities in the British Museum, to  discuss the proposed               excavation. I explained to him my  plans, and presented five or six               possible sites, Tel  Lachish being one of them. Barnett, after listening                carefully to all suggestions, unhesitatingly favoured Lachish, and                convinced me to undertake its re-excavation. That was about a  decade               after the publication of his article on the Lachish  reliefs and               the siege ramp (Barnett 1958). Barnett  enthusiastically emphasized               the importance of the reliefs  and the potential of continued excavations               at the site. I  remembered Tel Lachish very well from the days of               my  compulsory army service in the 1950s, when we regularly roamed                the area in our manoeuvres, and from all I had learned since my                boyhood about the biblical city, the Lachish letters, and the  murder               of Lachish's previous excavator, J.L. Starkey. I  could still see               in my mind's eye a picture of the ostraca  in the Rockefeller Museum,               which I visited with my father  as a young boy before the 1948 war.               So it did not take  Barnett long to convince me that I should excavate                Lachish. I must add in retrospect, nearly thirty years later, that                I have never regretted this decision, even for a second.</p></td>
